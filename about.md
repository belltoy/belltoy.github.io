I am a programmer, using Vim as the major editor. I like Unix/Linux things, and Mac things too. I was used some languages and technologies, and recently I am focus in Node.js development and Erlang/Elixir learning.

Beside above, I am interesting in some other things as well. Take bicycle and photographing for example. You can follow me if you like these too.
